# Burstpool written in GO

## Highlights

- SSE4 + AVX2 support
- fair share system based on estimated capacity
- grpc api
- can use multiple wallets as backends using the wallet API
- can talk directly to wallet database
- dynamic payout thresholds/intervals based on messages on the blockchain

## Requirements

- mariadb
- go > v1.9

## Setup

1. Create database

``` shellsession
echo "create database `<dbname>`" | mysql -u <user> -p
```

2. Import schema

``` shellsession
mysql -u <user> <dbname> < schema.sql
```

4. Edit config (see config section for settings)

5. Run make

``` shellsession
make
```

## Config

``` yaml
# numeric id of pool
# all miners should set their reward recipient to
# this numeric id
poolPublicId: 10282355196851764065

# secret phrase of the poolPublicId
# used for transactions
secretPhrase: "I shall never let anyone know my secrete phrase"

# the pool can talk to multiple wallets with failover
# at least one is needed for it to work
walletUrls:
    - "http://176.9.47.157:6876"

# pending for miners will increase until
# this threshold (in planck) is reached
# then payout happens
minimumPayout: 25000000000 # in planck

# txFee used for transaction in planck
txFee: 100000000

# blocks after blockHeightPayoutDelay will be checked
# if they were won or not (in order to avoid forks)
blockHeightPayoutDelay: 10

# share of pool on forged blocks:
# 1.0  = 100%
# 0.01 = 1%

# all deadlines bigger than this limit will
# be ignored
# the limit will be sent as "targetDeadline" in
# the getMiningInfo response
# in s

# all deadlines of blocks with a generation time < tMin
# will be discarded for calculating the effective capacities
# this helps miners with bigger scan time

# deadlines of the last nAvg blocks with a generation time > tMin
# will be used to estimate the capacities
nAvg: 20

# until nMin confirmed deadlines a miner's historical share is 0

# block height when poc2 validation starts
# defaults to max uint64

# fee for enabling weekly payout
# first payment in seven days from now
setWeeklyFee: 100000000


# fee for enabling daily payout
# frist payment in one day from now

# fee for setting a custom payout threshold
# payment if pending >= threshold + txFee
setMinPayoutFee: 500000000
```

## Dynamic Payout

Miners can send messages to the pool account to change their payment
thresholds/intervals.

The following messages (unencrypted) are supported:

### now
- forces a payout if you have a positive balance
- after that pool defaults are set

### daily
- forces a daily payout if you have a positive balance at the time, when the payment is made

### weekly
- forces a weekly payout if you have a positive balance at the time, when the payment is made

### 0
- reset to pool's defaults
- any existing recurring payment settings will be removed

### 12345 or similar (unsigned integer) in **planck**
- you can set any integer value you like to eg. 12345
- payment is done after you pass this threshold + txFee with your pendings
- any existing recurring payment settings will be removed
